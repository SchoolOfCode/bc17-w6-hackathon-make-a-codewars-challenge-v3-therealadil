# Kata code challenge - create a Palindrome

This challenge involves desiging and testing our very own Kata, aka a coding challenge, to be solved by other students. Using unit testing, we are able to challenge the user to write the correct function so that it passes the tests that we have set up.

## Planning

In this challenge, I initially made a simple kata challenge which was to write a function that takes a number and returns ODD if the number was odd and EVEN if the number was even. As this was quite simple, I decided to make a more complex challenge, which was to write a function that checks if a word is a palidnrome, returning true or false if it is or is not.

### Tests

- **Basic Tests**: Check if the function returns `true` for palindromes and `false` for non-palindromes.

- **Case Sensitivity Tests**: Verify that the function handles different cases correctly, such as:
  - Lowercase
  - UPPERCASE
  - rAnDoMCAsE

No matter the case, the function should include logic to make sure all character case is the same.

### Improvements
- This could be improved by making the function work and corresponding tests to work when there are space, because at the moment the only thing that can be passed into the function is a single string with no spaces.


## The challenge

### Installation / setup

1. Clone this repository with the git clone command
2. In the terminal run 'npm install', this will install the correct packages
3. Run 'npm run test', this will run the test continiously each time you save

### Writing the function to pass the test

- Your work should be completed in the "main.js" file, this is where the function is located.
- The function will be exported to the "main.test.js" file so that the tests I have set up can be checked on it.
- There is a hint in the main.js file.
- The solution is also in a file but it is currently in .gitignore
