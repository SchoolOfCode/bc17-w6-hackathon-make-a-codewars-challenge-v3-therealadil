// Hello Challenger 

// Your mission is to create a function named `palindrome` that takes a string as input and returns `true` if the string is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise. 

// Palindrome/ˈpalɪndrəʊm/: a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. racecar 🏎️

// Examples to guide you:
//      - `palindrome("racecar")` should return `true` because "racecar" is a palindrome. 🔄
//      - `palindrome("icecream")` should return `false` because "icecream" is not a palindrome. ❌

// Note: The function should be case-insensitive, treating "Racecar" and "racecar" as the same. 

// If you're stuck check the hint file.

//Good luck. 🚀👽🥶


export function palindrome(string) {
//  write your code below... 
}
